# Neural Network(s) From Scratch

Implemented the [multilayer perceptron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilayer_perceptron) from scratch in both *Python/Numpy* and *MATLAB*. Both implementations are object oriented (the Python one is neater).

Features
- Batchnorm Layers
- Cross Entropy Loss
- Kaiming initialization
- K-Fold Cross Validation
- Tanh, Sigmoid, ReLU activation functions
- Momentum updates
