# Swift.ly Analysis Project

## Introduction
What external factors can influence public transportation decisions?

This was a group project given out in the Olin School of Business. Our Professor was a data scientist at a transportation startup, and brought with him actual datasets from the company. The startup, called Swift.ly, specializes in utilizing information like Uber prices and travel time to help users make informed transportation decisions.

The data we analyzed was from user app data. Using skills that we acquired in R and sqldf (the SQL package in R, which is essentially the same thing as SQL), we cleaned up the datasets, merged them, and vizualized any interesting trends using the ggplot package in R.

The goal of the project was to engage in **exploratory data analysis**. We were given several open ended questions (among metrics like income, population density, distance, and time, what factors affect travelling habits, and how so?) and around 67,000 data points across several .csv files. There was not an incredible amount of cleaning work necessary (many data points did have missing data, however), but joining the spreadsheets, along with excluding irrelevant data to make for clearer visualization of trends, did require some effort and thought.

We used ggplot2 to visualize the data of the data as bar graphs, histograms, pie charts, and scatter graphs. As per project criteria, vizualization did not necessarily have to be (at least from my graphic design standards) pretty.

The project was a great way to get our feet wet in data analysis. The spreadsheets were fun to work with, and the trends that we revealed gave some interesting options and insights to the company. In addition to analyzing the data, our group discussed  how our results could be used in the future and what additional data could be provided.
