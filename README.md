# Introduction

Hello,

I am Jacob Lee, an aspiring data scientist. I am a current senior at Washington University in St. Louis majoring in Marketing and Chinese, with a minor in Computer Science.

My skills so far include:
* R (advanced)
* SQL (intermediate)
* Java (intermediate)
* VBA (advanced)
* Python (basic)

In terms of statistical concepts, I am familiar with:

* Regression
  * Simple & multiple
  * Time series
  * Logistic
  * Avoiding pitfalls (collinearity, heteroskedasticity, outliers & leverage, etc)
* Decision trees
* Sentiment analysis
* Imputation

I also have extensive experience with these programs:

* Adobe Photoshop (advanced)
* Final Cut Pro (advanced)
* Microsoft Excel (begrudgingly *very* advanced)

And just to prove that I am human beyond these lists, I like jazz (as funky as it comes), I'm in an a cappella group, and I can speak in a passable Scottish accent.

Thanks,
Jacob Lee
