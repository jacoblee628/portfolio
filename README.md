## Projects
1. Perceptron Learning Algorithm (PLA)
   - Implementation of the PLA machine learning algorithm. Generates linearly separable data and applies the algorithm, classifying the data in finite time.
2. Top N List MapReduce Java implementation
   - A chain of two Hadoop MapReduce jobs that takes in the [Netflix Prize training data](https://www.kaggle.com/netflix-inc/netflix-prize-data/data) and outputs a top list of size N, based on the sum of movie review scores.
3. Sentiment Analysis on Ford Reviews
   - Created several models that predict the sentiment (positive or negative) of reviews. 
4. Logistic Regression (via Gradient Descent)
   - An implementation of logistic regression from scratch.
5. Test Performance of Linear Learning Algorithms (math)
   - Mathematically deriving in-sample (training) and out-sample (test) error of a linear hypothesis set
   
## Skills

Programming languages:
* R (advanced)

* SQL (intermediate)
* VBA (advanced)

Other Technical Experience:
