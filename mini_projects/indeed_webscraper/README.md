# Indeed.com Webscraper
Language: Python
Tools: Jupyter Notebook, BeautifulSoup, Requests


This [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) script scrapes job posts from [Indeed.com](https://indeed.com) and saves the information as .json files for accessing later.

I included an example output for your reference.

I developed this tool for my [RNN Text Generator project](https://github.com/jacoblee628/job_posting_generator).

The code is pretty easy to reuse and repurpose. Feel free to use anything here.
