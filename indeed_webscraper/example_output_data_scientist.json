The iconic Tacoma Dome has endured as a high-demand venue for some of the largest names in the entertainment industry.<br/>\n<br/>\nA magnet for families looking for affordable housing options in the Puget Sound area, Tacoma also draws those who prefer to live in a more urban downtown setting with competitively priced condos and apartments that feature panoramic mountain and water views.<br/>\n<br/>\nTacoma's natural beauty and proximity to the Puget Sound and Mount Rainier draws hikers, runners, bicyclists, and maritime enthusiasts to the area.
